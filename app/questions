1) Explain REST and RESTful
-> REST: acronym for REpresentational State Transfer,
 it is architectural style that help to build communication between client and servers.
 It is caracterized by being stateless.
 Systems that apply this architecture are called RESTful systems, it is a description of this kind of systems.
2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
the client send requests over HTTP to get or modify resources, the server accept this requests and send responses.
3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
GET — retrieve a specific resource or a collection of resources
POST — create a new resource
PUT — update a specific resource
DELETE — remove a specific resource
4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
stateless protocol is a protocol that don't depend on the previous state of a request, however a stateful protocol is a
protocol that requires a server to save all states of previous requests.
HTTP is a stateless protocol.
5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
GET is used to retrieve resources by giving some information about this resources like id,
 this inforamtions are passed in header of the HTTP request.
 POST is used to add new resources, the information about the new resources are passed in the body of the HTTP request.
6) You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
1- google it
2- ask someone who have better knowledge
3- ask on communities and forums, like stackoverflow.
